# workdayScheduler

## Description

This is a program that will help you plan your workday. You can set a description on what you will do at each hour and the colors will tell you whether the event is in the past, present, or future.

## Experience

This was a surprising challenge in that I did not expect it to be as simple yet difficult. I have a hard time with jquerry, so this helped me solidy my knowledge. It was also nice to traverse the DOM once I got the hang of it.
